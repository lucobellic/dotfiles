# Instructions

Always use Context7 MCP when you need library/API documentation,
code generation, setup or configuration steps without me having to explicitly ask.

For general questions, or when you require more knowledge or information,
perform a web search to gather information online.

When using GitHub based model do not use subagent,
instead use the main agent to perform all tasks.
